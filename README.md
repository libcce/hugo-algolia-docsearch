![Docsearch-front-page](https://snipcart.com/media/204589/docsearch-front-page.png)

Today we'll be looking at how a static site search feature can be integrated into your JAMstack site via plugins or 3rd-parties. We’ll be doing this with Algoria’s DocSearch, a killer software that makes adding search to your technical documentation ridiculously easy no matter what SSG you’re using. 

More specifically, in this post, we’ll cover:

* Quick review of Hugo SSG
* Explanation of Algoria
* A look at DocSearch
* DocSearch and the JAMstack
* Building our Hugo demo with a static site search feature

Hope you enjoy!
